# **UCB FinTech Bootcamp Module 4 Challenge**
# *Portfolio Analysis*
## **Introduction**
### The Bootcamp *Module 4 Challenge - Portfolio Analysys*  consists of the analysis of four portfolios/funds (a.k.a 'Whales' due to their size); Paulson and Co, Berkshire Hathaway, Tiger Global Management and Soros Fund Management relative to the S&P 500 index. A csv file is provided with the net asset value (NAV) for these portfolios and the S&P 500.
---
## **Goals and Objectives**
### *Part I.* An analysis of risk/volatility for each one of the four portfolios relative to the S&P 500 index needs to be completed. 

### *Part II.* From the result of that initial analysis, two funds are to be picked for investment and further analyzed to calculate their beta and covariance relative to the S&P 500 using the rolling metrics approach.

## **Technologies and Tools**
### The following list includes the main technologies and tools using during the preparation and deployment of the solution:
### 1. *Python* - Programming language used to code the solution. Version 3.7.13 was used
### 2. *GitHub* - Reposotory for code deployment, version management and documentation of the presented solution
### 3. *Jupyter Labs* - IDE tool for coding, code testing/debugging and solution documentation. Version V3.4.4 was used
### 4. *Git Bash console* - Local console used to test the coded solution and sync wiht GitHub Version 2.40.0.windows.1 was utilized
### 5. *Slack* - Collaboration tool to communicate and brainstorm with other FinTech Bootcamp participants
### 6. *Operative System* - This solution was prepared in a PC running Windows 11 v H22

## **Installation Guide**
### No additional technologies from the ones listed above and used in prior challenges are needed
## **Solution Structure**

### The **[4.Portfolio Analysis](https://github.com/LUTOV001/4.Portfolio_Analysis)** repository in GitHub contains the solution components. The repository consists of the following folders, subfolders and contents as described below:
 
###    1. Resources: Includes the csv file with the porfolio data that the analysis is based on. 
###    2. gitignore : File with the file types/content to ignore when publishing to GitHub 
###    3. README.md - The preset file containing this outline
####   4. *risk_return_analysis.ipynb* is the Jupyter Notebook with the code for the core challenge solution 

## **User Instructions**
### 1. In the GitBash terminal launch the Jupyter Lab from the GitHub repository folder clone using the following command line:
```python 
jupyter lab
```
### 2.From the Jupyter Lab terminal, navigate to the open the *risk_return_analysis.ipynb* notebook
### 3.Run the steps in sequence and verify the results as per the comments, including outputs on the screen for the dataframe printing and plots, following the instructions in the jupyter notebook
